VAR : 
    var declarations are function-scoped.
    They are hoisted to the top of thier function or global scope 

    problems :
    the var keyword allows the re-declartion of variables

    in Es6 , two keywords : let and const were introduced which does not allow the re-delcation of the variables.
    
LET : 
    let declarations are block-scoped (scoped to the nearest enclosing {})

    They are hoisted to the top of thier block

CONST :
    const declartions also are block-scoped like let
